Welcome to the GDI Portal documentation!

The GDI Portal is open-source data portal that supports users on dataset discovery and access request. This documentation introduces key concepts in the user portal, provides installation procedures as well as comprehensive reference sections.

The Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) Portal is your gateway to an extensive network of genomic datasets designed to advance research, policymaking, and healthcare across Europe. As part of the GDI initiative, the portal facilitates seamless access to over one million genome sequences, supporting breakthroughs in personalized medicine, diagnostics, and treatment strategies for various diseases, including cancer and rare conditions.

By integrating genomic, phenotypic, and clinical data, the GDI Portal enables researchers, scientists, and healthcare professionals to perform precise analyses, contributing to innovation in healthcare and scientific discovery. The platform offers powerful search and metadata filtering capabilities, allowing users to efficiently locate and request datasets relevant to their studies.

The portal ensures compliance with stringent data governance policies, safeguarding data privacy while promoting responsible data sharing. Whether you are a researcher looking for curated genomic datasets or a policymaker aiming to leverage data for informed decision-making, the GDI Portal provides a user-friendly interface to streamline dataset discovery and access management.

Explore the GDI Portal and become part of a collaborative effort to enhance healthcare outcomes and foster genomic research innovation. For more details about the broader GDI project, visit the official GDI website.
