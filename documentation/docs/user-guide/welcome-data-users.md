# Welcome to the GDI Portal

Welcome to the GDI Portal user guide!

**The GDI Portal connects you to Europe's largest network of genomic datasets**—over one million genome sequences from across European countries. As part of the 1+ Million Genomes Initiative, this portal enables federated and secure cross-border access to high-quality genomic data and related phenotypic information across European countries.

**This guide is for data users**—healthcare researchers, policy-makers, and professionals—who want to discover and request access to genomic datasets for research and clinical purposes.

## How it works

Access genomic datasets in three steps:

1. **Explore datasets:** Browse and search through detailed dataset information—search by any criteria such as keywords, research topics, disease areas, or allele frequency. [Explore datasets](/category/explore-datasets-1/).

2. **Request access:** Found a dataset you want to use? Submit an application to access it. You may need to provide documentation or requirements for your request, and you can invite collaborators to assist you with your application. [Request access](/category/request-datasets-1/).

3. **Access approved datasets:** Once your request is approved, you will receive an email with a link to the Secure Processing Environment (SPE) where you can securely download and work with the datasets.

   :::info Stay compliant

   All data are protected by governance frameworks and data access policies to ensure ethical and legal use. Remember to **use data responsibly** and according to the terms and agreements you signed during the application process.
