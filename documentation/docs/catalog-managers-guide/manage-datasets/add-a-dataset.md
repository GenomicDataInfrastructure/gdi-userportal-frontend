# Add a dataset

Create datasets to build your organisation's genomic data catalogue, and make them discoverable to researchers within and outside your organisation. New to adding datasets? Learn [**about datasets**](what-is-a-dataset.md) and how to describe them.

To add a dataset:

1. Go to **Datasets** from the main menu.

2. Select **Add Dataset**. 

3. Fill out the dataset form. This form captures the metadata of your genomic dataset. For guidance on filling out the form, see the definition of properties in the [DCAT-AP Vocabulary](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/r5r/releases/3.0.0/).

    - **Public:** Makes your dataset discoverable by all users in the [GDI Data Portal](https://portal.gdi.lu/)<sup>↗</sup>.
    - **Private:** Makes your dataset visible only to users within your organisation.

5. Fill out the form with data resource information. For guidance in filling out the form, see: [Add a data resource to your dataset](add-data-resource.md)

6. Select **Finish** to add your dataset. After your dataset is successfully created, the dataset details page opens.
