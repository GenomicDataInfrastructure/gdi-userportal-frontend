# Search and filter datasets

### Using the Search Bar

On the **GDI Portal Homepage**, you will find a prominent search bar. This is the starting point for searching datasets. You can enter any relevant search term, such as:

- Disease names (e.g., "cancer", "diabetes")
- Genomic data types (e.g., "genome sequence", "exome data")
- Specific research terms (e.g., "BRCA1", "pharmacogenomics")
- Keywords related to your research interest

Once you enter a search term and hit **Enter**, you will be navigated to the **Search Results Page**, where you can refine your results further.

### Filtering Search Results

On the **Search Results Page**, you will see a list of datasets matching your search term. To narrow down your results, you can use the filters located on the left-hand side of the page. These filters allow you to refine your search based on different criteria, including:

- **Access Rights**: Filter datasets by their accessibility (e.g., "Open Access", "Restricted", or "Under Review").
- **Themes**: Select specific research themes or areas of interest related to the datasets (e.g., "Cancer", "Rare Diseases", "Genomics").
- **Keywords**: Use specific keywords related to your field of research (e.g., "BRCA", "RNA-seq", "genetic variation").
- **Publishers**: Filter datasets by the publisher or data provider (e.g., "GDI Initiative", "National Cancer Institute").
- **File Formats**: Choose the file formats that best suit your research tools or analysis needs (e.g., "FASTQ", "VCF", "CSV").

As you select different filter options, the results will update automatically to reflect your selections. This allows you to drill down to exactly the data you need for your research.

If you are **logged in**, you will have access to additional filters that can further refine your search, providing more precise dataset discovery options. Additionally, some datasets are only available to authenticated users, meaning logging in may reveal more datasets that were previously hidden when browsing anonymously.
