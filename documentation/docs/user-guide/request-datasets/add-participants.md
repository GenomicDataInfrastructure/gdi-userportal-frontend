The GDI Portal provides the ability to collaborate with other users on an application. Once you've created your application, you can invite others to join and contribute by adding them as participants. To do so, simply click on the **Add Participant** button on the application details page.

Collaborators can view the application, provide input, and help complete any missing details. This is especially useful for research teams or projects that involve multiple contributors. All participants added to the application will have access to the same details, ensuring everyone involved is on the same page. The collaboration feature makes the request process more efficient and transparent, allowing for better teamwork on dataset access requests.
