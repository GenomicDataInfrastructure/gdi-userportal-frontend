# About

The Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project aims to enable access to
genomic and related phenotypic and clinical data to improve research,
policymaking, and healthcare across Europe. The GDI project aims to
unlock a data network of over one million genome sequences for
research and clinical reference. This will create unprecedented
opportunities for transnational and multi-stakeholder actions in
personalised medicine for cancer, common, rare, and infectious diseases
as well as access to a reference genome collection representing the
European population (Genome of Europe).

### User Portal

The User Portal, developed by the Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI)
project, is the central entry point for accessing genomic data. As
part of the Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project, it unlocks a
vast repository of over one million genome sequences, this platform is
currently under development and will serve as the main European-level
hub for data access, providing a user-friendly interface for
researchers and healthcare professionals.

### Key Objectives

- To link and to provide cross-border access to genomic and related phenotypic datasets across Europe
- To advance understanding of genomics for more precise and faster clinical decision-making, diagnostics, treatments systems, and to benefit the overall economy
- To align with the development under the European Health Data Space (EHDS)
- To facilitate research, policymaking, and healthcare improvements
- To maintain awareness, acceptance, and trust in the main groups of stakeholders, notably European citizens, data holders, healthcare professionals, researchers, and public health authorities
