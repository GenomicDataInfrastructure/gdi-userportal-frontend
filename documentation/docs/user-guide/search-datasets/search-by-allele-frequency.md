# Search by allele frequency

### 2.4 Allele Frequency

Another powerful feature of the GDI Portal is the **Allele Frequency Query**. This tool allows you to search for specific genomic variants and find datasets where those variants are present.

To use this feature:

1. Navigate to the **Allele Frequency Query Page**.
2. Specify the **Reference Genome** you are interested in. Available options include:
   - **GRCh37** (Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37)
3. Enter the genomic variant details:
   - **Start Position**: Specify the start position of the genomic variant (e.g., `45864731`).
   - **End Position**: Specify the end position of the variant (e.g., `45864731`).
   - **Reference Name**: Enter the chromosome number (e.g., `3` for chromosome 3).
   - **Reference Base**: Enter the reference base (e.g., `T` for Thymine).
   - **Alternate Base**: Enter the alternate base (e.g., `C` for Cytosine).
   - **Cohort**: Specify the cohort or population group (e.g., European, Asian).

4. Click **Search**.

The results will show datasets that contain the specified allele or variant, along with relevant information about the datasets such as the sample size, associated phenotype, and data access restrictions.

This feature is particularly useful when you need to explore datasets based on the presence of specific genomic variants across multiple populations or research themes
