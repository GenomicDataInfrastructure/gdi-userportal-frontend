# Track application

### Tracking and Managing Applications

After creating and submitting your application, you can track its progress from the **Applications Page**. This centralized location lets you:

- View all active and past applications in one place.
- Check the current status of each application to see if it's in **Draft**, **Submitted**, **Approved**, or **Rejected**.
- Receive notifications if additional documentation is required or if your application needs further attention.
- Access datasets directly from the portal once your application has been approved.

### Application Statuses

Applications undergo several stages as they move through the approval process. The following are the key application statuses:

- **Draft**: Your application is being prepared and can be modified. This is the initial status where you can add information, attach documents, and edit the application.
- **Submitted**: The application has been sent for review and cannot be edited further. This marks the official submission of your request to the dataset provider.
- **Approved**: The application has been approved, granting you access to the requested datasets. You will be notified, and you can begin retrieving the data.
- **Rejected**: The application has been declined, and feedback may be provided regarding the reasons for the rejection. You can use this feedback to improve future applications.

Each application status is updated in real-time on your **Applications Page**, so you can always keep track of where your request stands.
