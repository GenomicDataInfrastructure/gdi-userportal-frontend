For example, a genomic data for COVID-19 Viral Sequences can include dataset records describing patient data, virus samples, and sequencing results. Dataset components A dataset in GDI has two sets of information that provide a complete picture of the genomic subject: metadata and data resources. :::tip Why is this important? The metadata and data resources you provide when creating datasets impact how easily users can find and understand them. When creating datasets, provide comprehensive information to help researchers find the data they need to support their studies. ::: Metadata Metadata are descriptive details about your genomic dataset that provide context and information about the dataset itself. It includes details pertaining to: - Identification: Title, description, keywords, and unique identifiers - Responsibility: Contact points, publisher, creator, and data steward information - Access information: Rights, availability, licensing, and access restrictions - Others: Other key information that allows users to locate and access the data. In the GDI Catalogue, the metadata appears under Additional Info when you open a datase. Here's an example: Data resources A data resource is a file that contains the actual genomic information. GDI supports the following file types as data resources: - VCF (Variant Call Format): For storing gene sequence variations - FAST/FASTQ: For storing raw sequence reads - BAM/CRAM: For storing aligned sequence data - CSV/TSV: For storing tabular data such as phenotypic You can also add links to external data resources. Here's an example of a data resource file in a dataset: Each data resource has its own metadata, including: access details, descriptions, legal information, and other relevant information that helps users understand and assess the data if it meets their research needs. :::tip Organising datasets Datasets in GDI can be organised in serveral ways—such as by organisation and groups—to help you manage data effectively, while making it easy for researchers to find relevant datasets. ::: What's next: Add a dataset.",

      "content": "Welcome, catalogue managers Welcome to the GDI Data Catalogue guide! The GDI Data Catalogue is where you manage and publish genomic dataset records that contribute to Europe's largest network of federated genomic datasets, as part of the 1+ Million Genomes Initiative. This guide is for catalogue managers—data managers, stewards, and backoffice users—responsible for managing genomic data resources of their organisations and ensuring they are discoverable. Learn more about Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) and its founding initiatives. How it works The GDI Data Catalogue serves as the backend system behind the GDI Data Portal and is accessible at https://catalogue.portal.gdi.lu. Here's how it works: - Organisations manage datasets: Contributing organisations use this catalogue to create and maintain their genomic dataset catalogue. - Controlled visibility: Organisations can publish datasets as public (visible to all users) or private (visible only within their organisation). - Datasets become discoverable: Published datasets appear as searchable content in the GDI Data Portal, where researchers can find genomic data resources and request access. Your role in GDI As a catalogue manager of your organisation, you are responsible for: - Publish datasets: Create and maintain comprehensive descriptions of your organisation's genomic data. - Managing discoverability: Ensure datasets are visible to the appropriate audience. - Maintaining dataset quality: Keep dataset information accurate, complete, and up to date. What would you like to do? - Add datasets: Upload new research data to the catalogue - Manage organisations: Oversee your institution's data presence - Maintain quality: Ensure data descriptions meet standards - Collaborate with teams: Work with colleagues on data publishing - Support data users: Help researchers find relevant datasets",

      "title": "_editorial style guide",
      "content": "Editorial style guide Writing style and voice Use clear, neutral, and device-agnostic language to ensure documentation is applicable across devices, platforms, and users. These guidelines are especially useful for writing instructions and how-to guides. Serial comma Always use serial comma (Oxford comma) when citing three or more items. This avoids ambiguity. Bad: You need the security combination, code and key. (Do I need one? Two? Or three things?) Good: You need the security combination, code, and key. (Clear. Three requirements.) Bad: I informed my parents, Gary and Lena. (Did you inform two people?) Good: I informed my parents, Gary, and Lena. (Clear. Four people—your parents and two others). Active voice not passive Use active voice whenever possible. This improves clarity and conciseness, and helps users understand who is doing what. Bad: The file must be uploaded to a secure folder. The file is reviewed by the data engineer. Good: Upload the file to a secure folder. The data engineer reviews the file daily. Bad: Roles and Permissions Configuration Good: Manage Roles and Permissions Use passive voice only when the actor is unknown or irrelevant, or if the outcome is more important than the actor. Good: - Data is ingested every Monday at 09:00 (CET) (Emphasis on data ingestion) - During the security breach, all data were deleted. (The actor is unknown) \"Select\" not \"click\" Use device-agnostic language. Bad: Click Submit. Good: Select Submit. \"Enter\" not \"type\" Use device-agnostic language. Bad: Type your password. Good: Enter your password. \"They\" not \"he/she\" Use neutral language. Bad: Contact the affected user and ask for his/her user ID. Good: Contact the affected user and ask for their user ID. Navigation terms Use simple, easy-to-translate words like \"Go to\" for navigating menus or User Interface (UI). Bad: Navigate to My Profile > Settings. Good: Go to My Profile > Settings. Use \"Open\" for launching apps, files, or pages. Bad: Launch the MDC app. Go to the MDC app. Good: Open the MDC app. State the goal or location before the action, especially for critical actions and tutorials. Good: - Under the Security section, select Advanced. (Location precedes action) - To delete all profiles, select Reset. (Critical action. Goal precedes action.) Headings and titles Don't number headings Numbered headers are inefficient for two reasons—they cause broken links when renumbered, and they confuse users who arrive from a page or process where the numbering does not reflect their actual journey. Instead of relying on fixed numbers, let the content of each step convey order. Bad: Step 1. Create a Dataset (This may not be the first step for all users) Good: Create a dataset (A clear title conveys the order to the user) Do use sentence case for headings and titles Only capitalise the first word and proper nouns. Bad: How it Works Good: How it works Use headers in the correct order Use H1 for the main title, and use it only once in a document or page. Structure the content logically with H2 > H3 > H4 headers, and avoid skipping levels. Using proper headers enhances your document in several ways: - It generates an accurate table of contents. - It supports accessible navigation for screen readers. - It enhances linking and search. Language and grammar UK vs US English Use UK English by default. We write for European-based partners, and this ensures alignment across content. Avoid switching between UK and US spellings within the same document. Bad: Organization, behavior, analyze Good: Organisation, behaviour, analyse Numbered vs bulleted lists Format your lists accurately according to their purpose to avoid confusion. - Numbered list: to state three or more items whose order cannot change. - Bulleted list: to state three or more items whose order can change. For longer bullet items, use a \"Label: Description\" format for better readability. Good: Key features of MDC include: - User access: Users log in via SSO using their organisation credentials. - Deployment options: MDC supports both cloud and on-premise deployments. Tip: Use a period (.) at the end of a bullet point only when each item completes the introductory sentence. 👉🏻 Also see Formatting numerical data Contractions Avoid using contractions to ensure clarity and maintain consistency with our Tone of Voice. Spell out common contractions—including \"don't\", \"you're\", and \"it's\"—especially in critical instructions or warnings. If you must use contractions, use them sparingly and only if they improve comprehension and the overall flow of the sentence or paragraph. Bad: Don't restart your device while updates are... (Critical instruction) Good: Do not restart your device while updates are ongoing. Bad: You're required to back up your data… (Spell out or use active voice) Good: You are required to back up... (or The system requires you to back up…) Other punctations Use the right punctations to prevent ambiguity, especially in instructions and policy documents. Quotation marks: Use double quotation (“ ”) for direct quotations, or literal values that the user must use or provide. Use single quotation (' ') for quotes within quotes. Good: In the search box, enter “Policy 123”. The announcement says, “Report all ‘Critical Error 555’ warnings to the IT department”. Hyphens, en dashes, and em dashes: Hyphen (-) to join compound words En dash (–) to show ranges or relationships. Em dash (—) to insert a break or emphasis in thought, or related independent clauses. Good: Access reports with real-time monitoring tools. (Hyphen) Data ingestion runs from 09:00–12:00 daily. (En dash) The system completed the job—no further action is required. (Em dash. Also works with a period.) Tips: Use hyphens for compound adjectives before nouns (example: real-time data) Don’t use hyphens when the phrase comes after the noun (example: access data in real time). Colons and semicolons - Colons (:): to introduce examples or clarify items in lists. - Semicolons (;): to separate closely related independent clauses or items in a complex list. Good: - Required fields include: email, password, and key. (Colon) - The system completed the update; no further action is required. (Semicolon. Also works with a period). Visual elements Keep technical diagrams and screenshots simple and consistent. They should support the content, not distract from it. Diagrams Use the same diagramming tool within the documentation, aligning the brand or theme colour schemes. Diagramming tools: - Mermaid - Drawio Screenshots Red rectangle as click indicator, if needed Use it to emphasise areas of interaction such as buttons or fields. Avoid it if the element is visually obvious, such as coloured buttons and single targets. Recommended formatting: - Line thickness: 1.5px - Outline colour: #E51F26 (LNDS red) Subtle grey border Add a solid, subtle grey border in all screenshots to separate them from the body text. Recommended formatting: - Line thickness: 1px - Outline colour: #D2D9DB (LNDS grey) or #DFE1E6 (Subtle grey for Confluence) What to avoid - Remove personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive partner data in screenshots. - Remove shadows and any decorative elements. Good: Pictures and icons Align all other visuals with the accessibility guidelines and our brand identity guides: - Style of Pictures for Websites - LNDS Icons and Visuals Inclusive and accessible writing Ensure the documentation can be used by everyone, including people who use assistive technology such as screen readers. Avoid deep nesting of navigation items: When writing instructions, Avoid more than three levels of navigation: When writing instructions or when creating nested pages, write up to three levels of navigation. Keep the content hierarchy as flat as possible to helps users find information quickly. Good: Go to Settings > Security > Password, and enter your password. (Instructions) Getting Started > Manage Datasets > Add a Dataset. (Nested pages) Alternative texts to all images: Provide alternative texts (alt texts) that are descriptive, for users reading with assistive technologies. Bad: alt=\"Picture of a diagram\" Good: alt=\"Diagram of ingestion, transformation, and serving\" Use descriptive links: Avoid “click here”. Use the goal or destination as display texts for links. Bad: Click here for the template. Good: Download the template. Introduce tables and lists: Describe their purpose or summary. Enumration formats When enumerating items within a sentence or paragraph, use the following formats for clarity: - Key phrase: Description of the item. Example: - Publishing dataset records: Create and maintain comprehensive descriptions of genomic datasets - Managing data discoverability: Ensure datasets can be found by researchers through the GDI User Portal",

In requirements.txt it may be set as or , if it causes the following error in the runtime , it should be downgraded to . 3. Install required extensions An extension can be cloned first to a desired location and then installed to the virtual environment from file, e.g.: For example on mac Or directly from Github location Then install dependencies: For example ckanext-harvest 4. Set up a postgres database, specify database connection string in and . Testing Testing strategy for a plugin would depend on plugin functionality. CKAN provides a number of helper functions allowing to generate dummy data in the database or clean the database afterwards. Please review official documentation for detailed info. To set up testing of a plugin make sure the following settings are configured correctly: 1. Make sure is installed to the virtual environment. Normally this dependency should be listed in of a plugin and therefore got installed. If you do not see it in output run . 2. Each plugin has an autogenerated file. Make sure it points to file of CKAN installation, e.g.: 3. Modify so configuration is correct. Most likely you need to modify parameter so it contains correct connection information: If testing of your plugin requires writing to the database it is recommended to set up a separate test instance of postgres database. Running tests Tests can be run via simple command or an extended one with desired options. The following example is to run tests with coverage: Per file/UT within PyCharm.

GDI CKAN container CRON Job for FAIR Data Harvesting Overview The GDI package, available from the GDI GitHub repository, includes a CRON job functionality designed to automate the harvesting of FAIR datapoints. This automation ensures continuous and efficient data collection without manual intervention. The harvesting process is initiated three background processes responsible for the operation: , and . Background Processes The harvesting operation relies on three main background processes: - : Manages the gathering of data sources to be harvested. - : Responsible for fetching the data from the sources identified by the gather process. - : Responsible for triggering the harvester at the end of each specified time interval (e.g., daily, weekly). These processes are crucial for the automated harvesting workflow, ensuring that data is continuously and efficiently collected and made available through the CKAN portal. Monitoring Process Status To monitor the status of these background processes, the command is used. Executing this command provides real-time status information about each process involved in the harvesting operation. Here's how to check the process status: Upon execution, you should see output similar to the following, indicating that both processes are running correctly: This output shows that both , and are in the RUNNING state, along with their respective process IDs and uptime, confirming their active operation within the system.",

      "content": "This document describes CKAN scheming strategy and ways to configure, replace and maintain dataset schemas. Schema format and fields definitions A CKAN schema can be difined either as JSON or YAML file. Civity keeps using .json schemas but in the official documentation there are a lot of yaml references as well. A field in CKAN schema .json file can be of the following format: where * is CKAN field id * is UI field representation * is a text appearing under a field in the UI next to icon, square brackets are omitted and in this particular example contain information about how this field maps to DCAT-AP. More about these mapping and custom fields read CKAN DB Structure and Fields Mapping Strategy. Documentation on field keys and other schemas specifications can be found in the CKAN GitHub official repository. Other possible fields keys are: * - maybe useful to solve cardinality issue, not used by Civity. * - not used by Civity, added recently, refers to stages on create dataset page and manages which field will appear on which stage. * - for a drop-down - a list of dictionaries with a value and label. * - to form a drop-down dynamically or from an API. It is possible for example to point to another schema and take a field from there. * - values like , , - to enable automatic checks and not to define snippets. * - interacts with CKAN UI, defines a field representation (related to data input), if do not want to use presets or want to have more control. jinja2-based format. * - also interacts with CKAN UI, defines how data are shown in the UI, e.g. showing an e-mail as “mail to“ link etc. * - useful if you need to override representation, e.g. in case you have mapping to DCAT, then: * - to validate data. Available functions are listed in the official documentation and it is possible to add custom ones. By default there is almost no validation (ignore_missing (accepts if a value is missing) and unicode), if you are specifying a custom one - these two basic needs to be added explicitly. It is possible to write and configure a validation function of your own. To do so one needs to implement an extension where extend a interface so method returns a custom validation function. See validation functions documentation for the reference. * - complex data structures if assigned to a field are converted to a string in the DB, this field defines a validator on extracting the field from the DB and re-converting to an object. Changing schema in a running CKAN instance Schema used is defined in by setting where is a part of CKAN Command Line Interface. For more info on usage review documentation. Therefore in a running docker container it is defined in a configuration file in parameter It should refer to an extension under directory of repository. To replace the schema run A change of file triggers ckan update so changes will be applied almost immediately. A schema should be defined in the following format: : the extension is expected to be cloned under e.g. the path from the example above () resolves to the following: !Scheming Multischeming declaration IDatasetForm is an interface scheming is taking charge of to override schemas. 1. In CKAN.ini file In multiple (space-separated) values can be defined. Behaviour for CKAN core and CKAN Civity-extended differs in a way that for core CKAN if two schemas have the same field, the system will pick up the latest. Civity improved this so two schemas of the same type are merged, the order of schemas specified in will be reflected in order of fields in the CKAN UI. Another ckan.ini parameter is defines rules for merging. If set to and if schemas to merge have the same fields, definitions from the latest one will be prioritized. Fields are never deleted though, only can be added or modified. To delete a field you need to undeclared a field or set to empty explicitly. This behaviour is implemented as part of ()and documented on code level only. 2. In a Multischeming declaration .json file Initially it was implemented by Civity to allow an extension to have it’s own schema which is merged into core schema. For maintenance purposes instead of managing schemas in ckan.ini file it is possible to provide a .json config file under with a content like the following: This also allows to have several schemas at the same time, e.g.: In ckan.ini file a property with a path to the file with schemas should be added, e.g.: Civity documentation on multiple schemas configuration. It is possible to control which datasets are declared via API: and then UI search of all dataset types is configured in parameter (see documentation).",

A dataset in GDI can be a single file or a collection of files that provide comprehensive genomic information about a specific research topic, disease area, or study cohort. For example, a genomic data for COVID-19 Viral Sequences can include dataset records describing patient data, virus samples, and sequencing results. Dataset components A dataset in GDI has two sets of information that provide a complete picture of the genomic subject: metadata and data resources. :::tip Why is this important? The metadata and data resources you provide when creating datasets impact how easily users can find and understand them. When creating datasets, provide comprehensive information to help researchers find the data they need to support their studies. ::: Metadata Metadata are descriptive details about your genomic dataset that provide context and information about the dataset itself. It includes details pertaining to: - Identification: Title, description, keywords, and unique identifiers - Responsibility: Contact points, publisher, creator, and data steward information - Access information: Rights, availability, licensing, and access restrictions - Others: Other key information that allows users to locate and access the data. In the GDI Catalogue, the metadata appears under Additional Info when you open a datase. Here's an example: Data resources A data resource is a file that contains the actual genomic information. GDI supports the following file types as data resources: - VCF (Variant Call Format): For storing gene sequence variations - FAST/FASTQ: For storing raw sequence reads - BAM/CRAM: For storing aligned sequence data - CSV/TSV: For storing tabular data such as phenotypic You can also add links to external data resources. Here's an example of a data resource file in a dataset: Each data resource has its own metadata, including: access details, descriptions, legal information, and other relevant information that helps users understand and assess the data if it meets their research needs. :::tip Organising datasets Datasets in GDI can be organised in serveral ways—such as by organisation and groups—to help you manage data effectively, while making it easy for researchers to find relevant datasets. ::: What's next: Add a dataset.",

      "content": "Welcome, catalogue managers Welcome to the GDI Data Catalogue guide! The GDI Data Catalogue is where you manage and publish genomic dataset records that contribute to Europe's largest network of federated genomic datasets, as part of the 1+ Million Genomes Initiative. This guide is for catalogue managers—data managers, stewards, and backoffice users—responsible for managing genomic data resources of their organisations and ensuring they are discoverable. Learn more about Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) and its founding initiatives. How it works The GDI Data Catalogue serves as the backend system behind the GDI Data Portal and is accessible at https://catalogue.portal.gdi.lu. Here's how it works: - Organisations manage datasets: Contributing organisations use this catalogue to create and maintain their genomic dataset catalogue. - Controlled visibility: Organisations can publish datasets as public (visible to all users) or private (visible only within their organisation). - Datasets become discoverable: Published datasets appear as searchable content in the GDI Data Portal, where researchers can find genomic data resources and request access. Your role in GDI As a catalogue manager of your organisation, you are responsible for: - Publish datasets: Create and maintain comprehensive descriptions of your organisation's genomic data. - Managing discoverability: Ensure datasets are visible to the appropriate audience. - Maintaining dataset quality: Keep dataset information accurate, complete, and up to date. What would you like to do? - Add datasets: Upload new research data to the catalogue - Manage organisations: Oversee your institution's data presence - Maintain quality: Ensure data descriptions meet standards - Collaborate with teams: Work with colleagues on data publishing - Support data users: Help researchers find relevant datasets",

      "title": "_editorial style guide",
      "content": "Editorial style guide Writing style and voice Use clear, neutral, and device-agnostic language to ensure documentation is applicable across devices, platforms, and users. These guidelines are especially useful for writing instructions and how-to guides. Serial comma Always use serial comma (Oxford comma) when citing three or more items. This avoids ambiguity. Bad: You need the security combination, code and key. (Do I need one? Two? Or three things?) Good: You need the security combination, code, and key. (Clear. Three requirements.) Bad: I informed my parents, Gary and Lena. (Did you inform two people?) Good: I informed my parents, Gary, and Lena. (Clear. Four people—your parents and two others). Active voice not passive Use active voice whenever possible. This improves clarity and conciseness, and helps users understand who is doing what. Bad: The file must be uploaded to a secure folder. The file is reviewed by the data engineer. Good: Upload the file to a secure folder. The data engineer reviews the file daily. Bad: Roles and Permissions Configuration Good: Manage Roles and Permissions Use passive voice only when the actor is unknown or irrelevant, or if the outcome is more important than the actor. Good: - Data is ingested every Monday at 09:00 (CET) (Emphasis on data ingestion) - During the security breach, all data were deleted. (The actor is unknown) \"Select\" not \"click\" Use device-agnostic language. Bad: Click Submit. Good: Select Submit. \"Enter\" not \"type\" Use device-agnostic language. Bad: Type your password. Good: Enter your password. \"They\" not \"he/she\" Use neutral language. Bad: Contact the affected user and ask for his/her user ID. Good: Contact the affected user and ask for their user ID. Navigation terms Use simple, easy-to-translate words like \"Go to\" for navigating menus or User Interface (UI). Bad: Navigate to My Profile > Settings. Good: Go to My Profile > Settings. Use \"Open\" for launching apps, files, or pages. Bad: Launch the MDC app. Go to the MDC app. Good: Open the MDC app. State the goal or location before the action, especially for critical actions and tutorials. Good: - Under the Security section, select Advanced. (Location precedes action) - To delete all profiles, select Reset. (Critical action. Goal precedes action.) Headings and titles Don't number headings Numbered headers are inefficient for two reasons—they cause broken links when renumbered, and they confuse users who arrive from a page or process where the numbering does not reflect their actual journey. Instead of relying on fixed numbers, let the content of each step convey order. Bad: Step 1. Create a Dataset (This may not be the first step for all users) Good: Create a dataset (A clear title conveys the order to the user) Do use sentence case for headings and titles Only capitalise the first word and proper nouns. Bad: How it Works Good: How it works Use headers in the correct order Use H1 for the main title, and use it only once in a document or page. Structure the content logically with H2 > H3 > H4 headers, and avoid skipping levels. Using proper headers enhances your document in several ways: - It generates an accurate table of contents. - It supports accessible navigation for screen readers. - It enhances linking and search. Language and grammar UK vs US English Use UK English by default. We write for European-based partners, and this ensures alignment across content. Avoid switching between UK and US spellings within the same document. Bad: Organization, behavior, analyze Good: Organisation, behaviour, analyse Numbered vs bulleted lists Format your lists accurately according to their purpose to avoid confusion. - Numbered list: to state three or more items whose order cannot change. - Bulleted list: to state three or more items whose order can change. For longer bullet items, use a \"Label: Description\" format for better readability. Good: Key features of MDC include: - User access: Users log in via SSO using their organisation credentials. - Deployment options: MDC supports both cloud and on-premise deployments. Tip: Use a period (.) at the end of a bullet point only when each item completes the introductory sentence. 👉🏻 Also see Formatting numerical data Contractions Avoid using contractions to ensure clarity and maintain consistency with our Tone of Voice. Spell out common contractions—including \"don't\", \"you're\", and \"it's\"—especially in critical instructions or warnings. If you must use contractions, use them sparingly and only if they improve comprehension and the overall flow of the sentence or paragraph. Bad: Don't restart your device while updates are... (Critical instruction) Good: Do not restart your device while updates are ongoing. Bad: You're required to back up your data… (Spell out or use active voice) Good: You are required to back up... (or The system requires you to back up…) Other punctations Use the right punctations to prevent ambiguity, especially in instructions and policy documents. Quotation marks: Use double quotation (“ ”) for direct quotations, or literal values that the user must use or provide. Use single quotation (' ') for quotes within quotes. Good: In the search box, enter “Policy 123”. The announcement says, “Report all ‘Critical Error 555’ warnings to the IT department”. Hyphens, en dashes, and em dashes: Hyphen (-) to join compound words En dash (–) to show ranges or relationships. Em dash (—) to insert a break or emphasis in thought, or related independent clauses. Good: Access reports with real-time monitoring tools. (Hyphen) Data ingestion runs from 09:00–12:00 daily. (En dash) The system completed the job—no further action is required. (Em dash. Also works with a period.) Tips: Use hyphens for compound adjectives before nouns (example: real-time data) Don’t use hyphens when the phrase comes after the noun (example: access data in real time). Colons and semicolons - Colons (:): to introduce examples or clarify items in lists. - Semicolons (;): to separate closely related independent clauses or items in a complex list. Good: - Required fields include: email, password, and key. (Colon) - The system completed the update; no further action is required. (Semicolon. Also works with a period). Visual elements Keep technical diagrams and screenshots simple and consistent. They should support the content, not distract from it. Diagrams Use the same diagramming tool within the documentation, aligning the brand or theme colour schemes. Diagramming tools: - Mermaid - Drawio Screenshots Red rectangle as click indicator, if needed Use it to emphasise areas of interaction such as buttons or fields. Avoid it if the element is visually obvious, such as coloured buttons and single targets. Recommended formatting: - Line thickness: 1.5px - Outline colour: #E51F26 (LNDS red) Subtle grey border Add a solid, subtle grey border in all screenshots to separate them from the body text. Recommended formatting: - Line thickness: 1px - Outline colour: #D2D9DB (LNDS grey) or #DFE1E6 (Subtle grey for Confluence) What to avoid - Remove personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive partner data in screenshots. - Remove shadows and any decorative elements. Good: Pictures and icons Align all other visuals with the accessibility guidelines and our brand identity guides: - Style of Pictures for Websites - LNDS Icons and Visuals Inclusive and accessible writing Ensure the documentation can be used by everyone, including people who use assistive technology such as screen readers. Avoid deep nesting of navigation items: When writing instructions, Avoid more than three levels of navigation: When writing instructions or when creating nested pages, write up to three levels of navigation. Keep the content hierarchy as flat as possible to helps users find information quickly. Good: Go to Settings > Security > Password, and enter your password. (Instructions) Getting Started > Manage Datasets > Add a Dataset. (Nested pages) Alternative texts to all images: Provide alternative texts (alt texts) that are descriptive, for users reading with assistive technologies. Bad: alt=\"Picture of a diagram\" Good: alt=\"Diagram of ingestion, transformation, and serving\" Use descriptive links: Avoid “click here”. Use the goal or destination as display texts for links. Bad: Click here for the template. Good: Download the template. Introduce tables and lists: Describe their purpose or summary. Enumration formats When enumerating items within a sentence or paragraph, use the following formats for clarity: - Key phrase: Description of the item. Example: - Publishing dataset records: Create and maintain comprehensive descriptions of genomic datasets - Managing data discoverability: Ensure datasets can be found by researchers through the GDI User Portal",

GDI CKAN container CRON Job for FAIR Data Harvesting Overview The GDI package, available from the GDI GitHub repository, includes a CRON job functionality designed to automate the harvesting of FAIR datapoints. This automation ensures continuous and efficient data collection without manual intervention. The harvesting process is initiated three background processes responsible for the operation: , and . Background Processes The harvesting operation relies on three main background processes: - : Manages the gathering of data sources to be harvested. - : Responsible for fetching the data from the sources identified by the gather process. - : Responsible for triggering the harvester at the end of each specified time interval (e.g., daily, weekly). These processes are crucial for the automated harvesting workflow, ensuring that data is continuously and efficiently collected and made available through the CKAN portal. Monitoring Process Status To monitor the status of these background processes, the command is used. Executing this command provides real-time status information about each process involved in the harvesting operation. Here's how to check the process status: Upon execution, you should see output similar to the following, indicating that both processes are running correctly: This output shows that both , and are in the RUNNING state, along with their respective process IDs and uptime, confirming their active operation within the system.",

Scheming extension of Civity allows more flexibility for managing extra fields than CKAN core default functionality but still such a field is converted to a string and lands in extra table. It is possible to write a mapper to and map all the extra fields. For DCAT there is an official extension: https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-dcat#json-dcat-harvester It is compatible with DCAT-AP v1.1 and 2.1 !Mapping Harvester tables In the DB there are several tables dedicated to store harvester-related information: * - harvested sources are defined * - the table where all the objects from a source are saved. Data from a source are stored in and from there will be converted to a CKAN dataset. harverters are also saved to table of harvest. Once you changed something in the DB directly, you must trigger re-indexing in Solr via search-index rebuild of CLI.",

      "content": "This document describes CKAN scheming strategy and ways to configure, replace and maintain dataset schemas. Schema format and fields definitions A CKAN schema can be difined either as JSON or YAML file. Civity keeps using .json schemas but in the official documentation there are a lot of yaml references as well. A field in CKAN schema .json file can be of the following format: where * is CKAN field id * is UI field representation * is a text appearing under a field in the UI next to icon, square brackets are omitted and in this particular example contain information about how this field maps to DCAT-AP. More about these mapping and custom fields read CKAN DB Structure and Fields Mapping Strategy. Documentation on field keys and other schemas specifications can be found in the CKAN GitHub official repository. Other possible fields keys are: * - maybe useful to solve cardinality issue, not used by Civity. * - not used by Civity, added recently, refers to stages on create dataset page and manages which field will appear on which stage. * - for a drop-down - a list of dictionaries with a value and label. * - to form a drop-down dynamically or from an API. It is possible for example to point to another schema and take a field from there. * - values like , , - to enable automatic checks and not to define snippets. * - interacts with CKAN UI, defines a field representation (related to data input), if do not want to use presets or want to have more control. jinja2-based format. * - also interacts with CKAN UI, defines how data are shown in the UI, e.g. showing an e-mail as “mail to“ link etc. * - useful if you need to override representation, e.g. in case you have mapping to DCAT, then: * - to validate data. Available functions are listed in the official documentation and it is possible to add custom ones. By default there is almost no validation (ignore_missing (accepts if a value is missing) and unicode), if you are specifying a custom one - these two basic needs to be added explicitly. It is possible to write and configure a validation function of your own. To do so one needs to implement an extension where extend a interface so method returns a custom validation function. See validation functions documentation for the reference. * - complex data structures if assigned to a field are converted to a string in the DB, this field defines a validator on extracting the field from the DB and re-converting to an object. Changing schema in a running CKAN instance Schema used is defined in by setting where is a part of CKAN Command Line Interface. For more info on usage review documentation. Therefore in a running docker container it is defined in a configuration file in parameter It should refer to an extension under directory of repository. To replace the schema run A change of file triggers ckan update so changes will be applied almost immediately. A schema should be defined in the following format: : the extension is expected to be cloned under e.g. the path from the example above () resolves to the following: !Scheming Multischeming declaration IDatasetForm is an interface scheming is taking charge of to override schemas. 1. In CKAN.ini file In multiple (space-separated) values can be defined. Behaviour for CKAN core and CKAN Civity-extended differs in a way that for core CKAN if two schemas have the same field, the system will pick up the latest. Civity improved this so two schemas of the same type are merged, the order of schemas specified in will be reflected in order of fields in the CKAN UI. Another ckan.ini parameter is defines rules for merging. If set to and if schemas to merge have the same fields, definitions from the latest one will be prioritized. Fields are never deleted though, only can be added or modified. To delete a field you need to undeclared a field or set to empty explicitly. This behaviour is implemented as part of ()and documented on code level only. 2. In a Multischeming declaration .json file Initially it was implemented by Civity to allow an extension to have it’s own schema which is merged into core schema. For maintenance purposes instead of managing schemas in ckan.ini file it is possible to provide a .json config file under with a content like the following: This also allows to have several schemas at the same time, e.g.: In ckan.ini file a property with a path to the file with schemas should be added, e.g.: Civity documentation on multiple schemas configuration. It is possible to control which datasets are declared via API: and then UI search of all dataset types is configured in parameter (see documentation).",
