# Search and filter datasets

Use the **search bar** and **filters** to find datasets relevant to your research. Both search and filters are available on all pages where browsing datasets is possible. This includes the **Home** page and the **Datasets** page.

[**Sign in**](/sign-in) to get comprehensive search results. While you can search datasets without an account, signing in allows you to filter and view more details in the search results, such as `record counts` and other metadata.

## Search datasets

On the **Home** or **Datasets** page, enter any term or phrase to search across all dataset information, including:

- Disease names, research topics, or data types
- Specific terms like gene names or scientific keywords  
- Any other information described in the dataset metadata

## Filter your results

Use the filters on the left side of the search results page to narrow down your results. These filters are based on dataset metadata, and signing in gives you access to additional metadata-based filters. Common filters include: Access Rights, Data Types, Themes, and Publishers.

Here's an example of a search result for the word "cancer", with filters applied for Access Rights: `Public` and Themes: `Colorectal Cancer` and `Health`.
