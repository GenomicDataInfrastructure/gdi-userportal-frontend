Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) is a project of the European Commission that aims to enable access to genomic and related phenotypic and clinical data to improve research, policymaking, and healthcare across Europe. It aims to unlock a data network of over one million genome sequences for research and clinical reference. Read more about GDI on the official GDI website. What is the GDI Portal? The GDI Portal is a key component of the Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project. It serves as the central entry point for accessing genomic data to unlock a repository of over one million genome sequences. This platform is currently under development and is designed to serve as the main European-level hub for data access. Who is the GDI Portal for? The GDI Portal is designed for anyone who needs access to genomic data, including researchers, data scientists, healthcare professionals, clinicians, and policymakers. Do I need an account to access the Portal? You do not need an account to access the GDI Portal—you can browse information (metadata) about the available datasets. However, you need to sign in to your account to request access to the dataset records. Signing in also enables add How does accessing data work? First, you need to find datasets of interest by browsing or searching the portal. Once you find a dataset you want to use, you need to submit an application to access the said data. You might be asked to provide additonal information such as your research purpose, institutional affiliation, and ethics approval documentation. The portal will guide you through these requirements when you apply. Once your application is approved, you will receive instructions on how to access the data. How long does it take to get approval? Approval times vary depending on the dataset, data controller, and complexity of your request. The portal will connect you with the relevant data controllers who manage the approval process. Can I access data from multiple countries? Yes, the GDI Portal enables cross-border access to genomic data across European countries through its federated network approach.",

This centralized location lets you: - View all active and past applications in one place. - Check the current status of each application to see if it's in Draft, Submitted, Approved, or Rejected. - Receive notifications if additional documentation is required or if your application needs further attention. - Access datasets directly from the portal once your application has been approved. Application Statuses Applications undergo several stages as they move through the approval process. The following are the key application statuses: - Draft: Your application is being prepared and can be modified. This is the initial status where you can add information, attach documents, and edit the application. - Submitted: The application has been sent for review and cannot be edited further. This marks the official submission of your request to the dataset provider. - Approved: The application has been approved, granting you access to the requested datasets. You will be notified, and you can begin retrieving the data. - Rejected: The application has been declined, and feedback may be provided regarding the reasons for the rejection. You can use this feedback to improve future applications. Each application status is updated in real-time on your Applications Page, so you can always keep track of where your request stands.",
