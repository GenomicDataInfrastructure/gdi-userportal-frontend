Create **groups** to organise datasets that have a common theme or purpose. For example, you may want to create groups based on research projects, studies, or other relevant criteria.

Groups are a great way to:

- **For catalogue managers:** Manage related datasets together.
- **For users:** Discover related datasets more efficiently. They can browse datasets within groups that align with their research.


## Create the group

Create groups to logically organise related datasets together.

1. Select **Groups** from the main menu.

2. Select **Add Group**.

3. Fill in the following fields:

   - **Name:** Enter a descriptive name for the group. The URL generates automatically based on the name. To change it, select *Edit* next to the generated URL. 
   - **Description:** (Optional) Enter a description or overview of the group. 
   - **Image URL:** (Optional) Add an image URL to visually represent the group. This image appears as a thumbnail 
   whenever the group is listed.  

3. Select **Create Group**. The newly created group opens and displays "No datasets found" since no datasets have been added yet.

## Add custom fields to the group

Add custom fields to groups to capture additional property or metadata specific to that group or your organisation's needs. For example, you might want to add fields for project codes, data sensitivity levels, or contact information. 

1. Open the group you want to add custom fields to.

2. Select **Manage**.

2. Scroll down to find **Custom Fields** and fill out the key and value for each property: 
    - **Key:** Represents the label. For example, *Project code*.   
    - **Value:** Represents the corresponding information for the key. For example, *PC-12345*.

3. Select **Update Group** to save the changes. The group details page opens. 

4. To view the custom fields you have added, select the **About** tab on the group details page. The custom fields appear under the **Additional Info** section.
