This page provides an overview of the Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) and its components.

## What is GDI?

The **Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI)** is Europe's federated network for genomic data sharing, enabling secure access to over one million genome sequences from across European countries.

**The 1+ Million Genomes Initiative:** GDI is the technical implementation of the European Union's 1+ Million Genomes Initiative, launched in 2018 when EU member states signed a declaration to create the world's largest genomic dataset for research and healthcare.

Key objectives of the 1+ Million Genomes Initiative include:
- **Advance personalised medicine:** Enable precision treatments based on genetic profiles
- **Accelerate rare disease research:** Provide researchers with unprecedented access to genomic data
- **Support population health:** Understand genetic variations across European populations
- **Maintain data sovereignty:** Keep genomic data under national control while enabling cross-border research

## How it works

GDI operates through two main portals that work together to create a seamless data sharing ecosystem:

- **GDI User Portal:** For researchers, clinicians, policy-makers and other data users
    - **Discover datasets:** Search and explore available genomic datasets across Europe
    - **Request access:** Submit access requests for research or clinical purposes  
    - **Access data:** Receive approved access to genomic data for authorised research
    - **Accessible at:** [portal.dev.gdi.lu](https://portal.dev.gdi.lu/)

- **GDI Data Catalogue:** For data stewards, catalogue managers, and data managers
    - **Publish datasets:** Add genomic datasets and metadata to the federated network
    - **Manage organisations:** Oversee institutional data contributions
    - **Configure harvesters:** Set up automated metadata collection from data sources
    - **Accessible at:** [catalogue.portal.gdi.lu](https://catalogue.portal.gdi.lu)

:::tip Dataset portals 

Dataset metadata published in the **Data Catalogue** becomes discoverable through the **User Portal**, creating a federated network where European genomic data remains distributed but searchable.

## Technical foundation

- **Federated architecture** - Data stays in original locations while metadata is shared
- **FAIR principles** - Data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable
- **Built on CKAN** - Uses proven open-source data portal technology
- **European standards** - Complies with GDPR and European genomic data sharing frameworks
