# Manage organisations

Control access to your institution's datasets by setting up organisations and managing team permissions.

**Organisations** represent institutions or teams that publish datasets in the GDI Data Catalogue. All datasets must belong to an organisation. Organisations allow you to:

- Group datasets by institutional ownership
- Control who can view, edit, or manage your datasets
- Assign role-based permissions to team members
- Maintain institutional branding and identity

Select a task to get started:

- **[Create organisation](/catalogue-managers-guide/manage-organisations/create):** Set up a new organisation for your institution
- **[Manage members](/catalogue-managers-guide/manage-organisations/manage-members):** Add members, assign roles, or remove members
