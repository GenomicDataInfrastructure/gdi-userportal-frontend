# Browse datasets by category

Browse datasets by **Themes** and **Publishers** directly from the main menu. While these categories are available as filters in the search page, you can access their dedicated sections from the main navigation menu for quick browsing.

Here's a quick demo of browsing datasets by **publishers:**

To browse datasets by theme or publisher categories:

1.  Select either **Themes** or **Publishers** from the main navigation menu.

2.  Select a category to view all datasets within that theme or publisher.

        After you select a theme or publisher, the **Datasets** page opens with pre-applied filters based on your selection. In this example, we selected the theme: *Health*, and `Health` is pre-applied as a filter with its resulting datasets.
