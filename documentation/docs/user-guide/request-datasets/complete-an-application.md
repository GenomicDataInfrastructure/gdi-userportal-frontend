# Continue an application

Continue working on applications that you or your collaborators have started earlier. All unsubmitted applications are saved as **draft**. 

To continue a draft application:

1. Select the **folder icon** on your dashboard. Your page opens with the list of your applications in the **Applications** tab. In this example, we have one `SUBMITTED` application and one `DRAFT` application:
<!-- 
<figure>
    <img src="img/request-access/applications.png" alt="Screenshot of the folder icon on user dashboard" width="0" />
    <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure> -->

<figure>
    <img src="img/request-access/application-list.png" alt="Screenshot of the application list" width="900" />
    <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

2. Select the draft application you want to complete. 

3. Complete the application form by providing all required information or uploading necessary documentation.

4. Review the **Terms & Conditions** and select **Accept All** to agree to the terms.

5. Select **Submit** to submit your completed application for review. You will receive a confirmation email and be notified of status updates.
