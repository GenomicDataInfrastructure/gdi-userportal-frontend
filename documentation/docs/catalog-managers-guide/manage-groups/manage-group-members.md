Groups support collaborative management through member roles. **Add members** to groups and assign them specific roles that determine their access to group settings and the genomic datasets within those groups.

## Group member roles

Each member in a group has one of the following roles:

- **Admin:** Edit group information and manage group members
- **Member:** Add or remove datasets from groups

## Add members to a group

You can add members to a group either **individually** or **in bulk** using a CSV file.

1. Select **Groups** from the main menu.

2. Open the group you want to add members to.

3. Select **Manage**, and then select **Members**.

5. To add members in bulk, select **CSV** to download the CSV template, and then fill out the file.

6. Select **Add Member** or upload the CSV file to complete the process.
