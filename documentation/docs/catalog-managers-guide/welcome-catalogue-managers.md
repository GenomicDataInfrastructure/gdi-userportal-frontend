# Welcome, catalogue managers

Welcome to the GDI Data Catalogue guide!

The **GDI Data Catalogue** is where you manage and publish genomic dataset records that contribute to Europe's largest network of federated genomic datasets, as part of the 1+ Million Genomes Initiative.

This guide is for **catalogue managers**—data managers, stewards, and backoffice users—responsible for managing genomic data resources of their organisations and ensuring they are discoverable.

Learn more about [Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI)](about-gdi.md) and its founding initiatives.

## How it works

The GDI Data Catalogue serves as the backend system behind the GDI Data Portal and is accessible at [https://catalogue.portal.gdi.lu](https://catalogue.portal.gdi.lu). Here's how it works:

- **Organisations manage datasets:** Contributing organisations use this catalogue to create and maintain their genomic dataset catalogue.
- **Controlled visibility:** Organisations can publish datasets as public (visible to all users) or private (visible only within their organisation).
- **Datasets become discoverable:** Published datasets appear as searchable content in the [GDI Data Portal](https://portal.gdi.lu/), where researchers can find genomic data resources and request access.

## Your role in GDI

As a **catalogue manager** of your organisation, you are responsible for:

- **Publish datasets:** Create and maintain comprehensive descriptions of your organisation's genomic data.
- **Managing discoverability:** Ensure datasets are visible to the appropriate audience.
- **Maintaining dataset quality:** Keep dataset information accurate, complete, and up to date.

## What would you like to do?

- **Add datasets:** Upload new research data to the catalogue
- **Manage organisations:** Oversee your institution's data presence
- **Maintain quality:** Ensure data descriptions meet standards
- **Collaborate with teams:** Work with colleagues on data publishing
- **Support data users:** Help researchers find relevant datasets
