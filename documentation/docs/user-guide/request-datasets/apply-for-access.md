# Apply for access to datasets

**Access datasets** you find in the GDI Portal. Depending on the dataset type, you can either submit an application through the portal for GDI datasets, or be redirected to external sources for externally governed datasets.

To apply for access to datasets:

1. [Browse or search](/category/explore-datasets) for datasets you want to access.

2. Select **Add to basket** on each dataset you want to access.

   You can add datasets directly from the search results:

   Or you can add the dataset from the dataset details page:

   :::info External datasets

   Some datasets may be managed by an external organisation. These datasets have an `Externally governed` label and cannot be added to the basket. To request access, select **Access External Dataset** and follow the link to the external source.
