# Add participants to your application

Invite other users as participants to help complete your application requirements and provide input. This is useful for teams or projects with multiple contributors, as all participants can access the same application details.

## How it works

After adding participants to your application, they can:

- View the application details
- Provide input and help complete missing information
- Upload required documentation
- Assist with form completion


## Add participants

To add participants to your application:

1. Select the **folder icon** to access your applications.

2. Under the **Applications** tab, select the application you want to add participants to.

3. Select **Add Participant** on the application details page.

4. Enter their **name** and **email address**, then select **Send**. This sends an email invitation to the participant with a link to access the application.

5. After the invitee accepts the invitation, they will appear in the **Participants** section of the application details page.
