# What is a dataset?

In GDI, a **dataset** is a comprehensive record that describes a genomic data resource. For example, a genomic data resource for *COVID-19 Viral Sequences* can include dataset records of: *patient data*, *virus samples*, or *hospital study results*.  

The quality of information contained in a dataset determines how easily users can find, understand, and access the genomic data resources it describes.

**A dataset can have two sets of information:** 
- **[Metadata:](#metadata)** Descriptive information
- **[Data resource:](#data-resource)** The actual genomic data files or services

## Metadata  

Metadata are descriptive details about your genomic dataset that provide context and information about the dataset itself. This includes details pertaining to:

    - **Identification:** Title, description, keywords, and unique identifiers
    - **Responsibility:** Contact points, publisher, creator, and data steward information
    - **Coverage details:** Geographic and temporal scope
    - **Access information:** Rights, availability, licensing, and access restrictions
     
    and any other pertinent information that allows users to effectively locate and use the data.

## Data resource

Data resources are the actual files, databases, or data services that contain the genomic information. This includes details pertaining to:

    - **Access details:** URLs for viewing or downloading the data
    - **Technical specifications:** File format, media type, file size, and compression details
    - **Descriptions:** What each specific file or resource contains
    - **Legal information:** Licensing, rights, and availability status

and any other relevant information that helps users understand and use the data resources.


## Example

A dataset record for *"Rare Genetic Forms of Diabetes Study"* would include:

- **Metadata:** Study description, clinic contact information, data collection period (2022-2025), patient privacy requirements.
- **Data resource:** Blood test results, genetic screening data in spreadsheet format, patient questionnaires, and study guidelines—each with download options, file sizes, and viewing permissions.

When you publish this dataset in the GDI Catalogue, researchers can discover it through the GDI User Portal. The details you provide help them understand what data is available, so they can assess if it meets their research needs, and request access if necessary.
