        The Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project aims to enable access to
        genomic and related phenotypic and clinical data to improve research,
        policymaking and healthcare across Europe. The GDI project aims to
        unlock a data network of over one million genome sequences for research
        and clinical reference. This will create unprecedented opportunities for
        transnational and multi-stakeholder actions in personalised medicine for
        cancer, common, rare and infectious diseases as well as access to a
        reference genome collection representing the European population (Genome
        of Europe).

      <p>
        The User Portal, developed by the Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI)
        project, is the central entry point for accessing genomic data. As part
        of the Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project, it unlocks a vast
        repository of over one million genome sequences, this platform is
        currently under development and will serve as the main European-level
        hub for data access, providing a user-friendly interface for researchers
        and healthcare professionals.{" "}
