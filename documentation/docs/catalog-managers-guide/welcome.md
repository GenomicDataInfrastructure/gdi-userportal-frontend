# Welcome, catalogue managers

Welcome to the GDI Dataset Catalogue guide!

**The GDI Dataset Catalogue is where you publish and manage genomic dataset records** that contribute to Europe's largest network of federated genomic datasets.  

The Dataset Catalogue is accessible at [https://catalogue.portal.gdi.lu](https://catalogue.portal.gdi.lu). The datasets you publish here become discoverable in the [GDI User Portal](https://portal.dev.gdi.lu/), where authorised users can find and request access to genomic data. 

**This guide is for catalogue managers**—data managers, stewards, and other professionals—responsible for managing genomic data resources and ensuring they are discoverable and accessible through Europe's Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI).

To learn more about the Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) and founding initiatives, see [About GDI](./about-gdi).
