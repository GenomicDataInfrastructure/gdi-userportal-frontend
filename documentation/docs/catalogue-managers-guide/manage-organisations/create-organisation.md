# Create organisation

Set up a new organisation to group your institution's datasets and manage team access. Create an organisation when:

- Your institution is joining the GDI Data Catalogue for the first time.
- You need to separate datasets by department or project team.
- You want to control access to datasets within your institution.

To create an organisation:

1. Go to **Organizations** and select **Add Organization**.

2. Fill out the organization form:
   - **Name:** Use your institution's official name for consistency across the GDI ecosystem
   - **URL:** Auto-generated from the organization name. Select edit to customise it
   - **Description:** Describe your institution and its role in genomic data management
   - **Image URL:** Link to an optional logo for your organization

3. Select **Create Organization** to save your organization. After your organisation is created, the organisation details page opens and you can start adding members and datasets.

## Next step

**[Manage members](./manage-members.md)** to invite your team and assign roles.
