# About

The **Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI)** project aims to enable access to genomic and related phenotypic and clinical data to improve research, policymaking, and healthcare across Europe. The GDI project seeks to unlock a data network of over one million genome sequences for research and clinical reference.

## User Portal

The **User Portal**, developed for the **Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI)** project, is the central entry point of the **1+MG initiative**. This platform is currently under development and will serve as the main European-level hub for data discovery and access to genomic data, providing a user-friendly interface for researchers and healthcare professionals.

## Key Objectives

- To link and provide cross-border access to genomic and related phenotypic datasets across Europe
- To advance understanding of genomics for more precise and faster clinical decision-making, diagnostics, and treatment systems, and to benefit the overall economy
- To align with developments under the **European Health Data Space (EHDS)**
- To facilitate research, policymaking, and healthcare improvements
- To maintain awareness, acceptance, and trust among the main stakeholder groups — notably European citizens, data holders, healthcare professionals, researchers, and public health authorities

## Contributing Organizations

The User Portal has been developed through a collaboration between the following organizations:

- [**Luxembourg National Data Service**](https://www.lnds.lu/)  
  The Luxembourg National Data Service is responsible for the development of the User Portal.

- [**Centre for Genomic Regulation**](https://www.crg.eu/)  
  The Centre for Genomic Regulation was responsible for the design and implementation of the original Allele Frequency Browser concept, which was later ported to the User Portal.

- [**Health-RI**](https://www.health-ri.nl/)  
  Health-RI is responsible for implementing the dataset catalogue integration with 1+MG infrastructures and enforcing a harmonised metadata model.
