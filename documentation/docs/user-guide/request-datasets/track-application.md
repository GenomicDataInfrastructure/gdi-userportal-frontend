To track your applications:

1. Select the **folder icon** to access your applications.

2. View all your applications under the **Applications** tab. On this page, you can:

    - View all active and past applications in one place
    - Check the current status of each application
    - Receive notifications if additional documentation is required

## Application statuses

Applications move through several stages during the approval process:

- **Draft**: The application has not been submitted and can be modified. You can add information, attach documents, and edit the application.
- **Submitted**: The application has been sent for review to the Data Access Committee. You can no longer edit it.
- **Approved**: The application has been approved, granting you access to the requested datasets. Select the **Entitlements** tab to view and download the data.
- **Rejected**: The application has been declined. Select the dataset to review the feedback and reasons for rejection.
