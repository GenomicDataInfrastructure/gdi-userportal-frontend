# Add data resource to your dataset

Add genomic data files and supporting resources to make them accessible through your dataset record in the GDI catalogue.

## Before you start

Ensure you have:
- Created a dataset record (see: [Add a dataset](add-a-datasets.md))
- Prepared your data files in supported formats
- Gathered any supporting materials and documentation
- Verified file permissions and access rights

## Add data resource

To add data resource to your dataset:

1. **Open your dataset** for editing from the **Datasets** page.

2. **Go to the Data Resource section** in the dataset form.

3. **Select Add Data Resource** to upload or link to your files.

4. **Choose what you're adding:**
   - **Data files:** Your main genomic data (VCF, FASTQ, CSV, etc.)
   - **Documentation:** Research papers, methodology descriptions, data dictionaries
   - **Analysis tools:** Scripts, notebooks, analysis pipelines
   - **Supporting files:** Reference data, annotation files, metadata
   - **Visualisations:** Charts, graphs, interactive displays
   - **External links:** Related datasets, project websites

5. **Fill in the details:**
   - **Name:** Descriptive name for your file or resource
   - **Description:** What this file or resource contains
   - **Format:** File type or service format
   - **Size:** File size information (for files)
   - **Access method:** Upload file or provide URL link

6. **Set access permissions:**
   - **Public:** Anyone can access this resource
   - **Restricted:** Requires permission to access
   - **Private:** Only you and authorised users can access

7. **Add technical information:**
   - File encoding and compression details
   - Quality metrics or validation information
   - Version and relationship information
   - Dependencies or requirements for use

8. **Save your changes** to make the data resource available through your dataset.

## Best practices

- **Use clear, descriptive names** that explain the content
- **Provide comprehensive descriptions** to help users understand what they're accessing
- **Include documentation** to help users understand and use your data
- **Group related files** logically within your dataset
- **Test external links** regularly to ensure they remain accessible
- **Keep resources up to date** with your data versions
- **Verify file integrity** before publishing
