# Apply for access to datasets

Found datasets you want to use? **Submit an application** to access and use the datasets. The Data Access Committee will review your application to ensure compliance with data use policies and ethical standards.

To apply for access to datasets:

1. [Browse or search](/category/explore-datasets-1) for datasets you want to access.

2. Select **Add to basket** on each dataset you want to include in your application. You can add datasets to your basket from multiple searches or browsing sessions. 

    For example, you can add datasets directly from the search results:

    Or you can add datasets from the dataset details page:
