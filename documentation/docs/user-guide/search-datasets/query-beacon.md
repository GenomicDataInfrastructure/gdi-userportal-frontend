# Query the Beacon Network

#### Querying the Beacon Network (For Logged-in Users)

If you are **logged in**, you will also have access to the **Beacon Network**, which allows you to query external genomic datasets beyond the GDI Portal. This federated search enables users to check the presence of specific genetic variants across multiple international genomic databases.

By leveraging the **Beacon Network**, researchers can identify additional datasets that contain the variants of interest, even if those datasets are not directly hosted within the GDI Portal.
