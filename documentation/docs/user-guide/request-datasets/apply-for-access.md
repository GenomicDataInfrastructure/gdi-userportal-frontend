To apply for access to datasets:

1. [Browse or search](/category/explore-datasets-1) for datasets you want to access.

2. Select **Add to basket** on each dataset you want to include in your application. You can do this from the search results or when you view the dataset details. This example shows adding a dataset to the basket from the search results:
