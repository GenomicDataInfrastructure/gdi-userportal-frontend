To browse datasets by category:

1. Select either **Themes** or **Publishers** from the main navigation menu. In this example, we selected **Themes**.

2. Select a category to view all datasets within that grouping.

    When you select a theme or publisher, the **Datasets** page opens with pre-applied filters based on your selection. In this example, we selected the "Health" theme, and `Health` is pre-applied as a filter.

## Browse by themes

Explore datasets grouped by research topics, disease areas, or specific field of interest. Here's an example of browsing datasets by the theme and drilling down to a specific dataset using filters and search.

## Browse by publishers

Browse datasets by their source organisations or institutions. This is useful when you want to explore data from specific data owners. Here's an example of browsing datasets by publishers and drilling down to a specific dataset using filters and search.
