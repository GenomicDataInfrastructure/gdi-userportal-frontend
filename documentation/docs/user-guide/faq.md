### What is GDI?

Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) is a project of the European Commission that aims to enable access to genomic and related phenotypic and clinical data to improve research, policymaking, and healthcare across Europe. It aims to unlock a data network of over one million genome sequences for research and clinical reference. Read more about GDI on the [official GDI website](https://gdi.onemilliongenomes.eu/about/).

### What is the GDI Portal?

The GDI Portal is a key component of the Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project. It serves as the central entry point for accessing genomic data to unlock a repository of over one million genome sequences. This platform is currently under development and is designed to serve as the main European-level hub for data access.

### Who is the GDI Portal for?

The GDI Portal is designed for anyone who needs access to genomic data, including researchers, data scientists, healthcare professionals, clinicians, and policymakers. 

### Do I need an account to access the Portal?

You do not need an account to access the GDI Portalâ€”you can browse information (metadata) about the available datasets. However, you need to sign in to your account to request access to the dataset records. Signing in also enables add

### How does accessing data work?

First, you need to find datasets of interest by browsing or searching the portal. Once you find a dataset you want to use, you need to submit an application to access the said data. You might be asked to provide additonal information such as your research purpose, institutional affiliation, and ethics approval documentation. The portal will guide you through these requirements when you apply. Once your application is approved, you will receive instructions on how to access the data.

### How long does it take to get approval?

Approval times vary depending on the dataset, data controller, and complexity of your request. The portal will connect you with the relevant data controllers who manage the approval process.

### Can I access data from multiple countries?

Yes, the GDI Portal enables cross-border access to genomic data across European countries through its federated network approach.
