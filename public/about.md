# About

The Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project aims to enable access to genomic and related phenotypic and clinical data to improve research, policymaking, and healthcare across Europe. The GDI project aims to unlock a data network of over one million genome sequences for research and clinical reference. This will create unprecedented opportunities for transnational and multi-stakeholder actions in personalised medicine for cancer, common, rare, and infectious diseases as well as access to a reference genome collection representing the
European population (Genome of Europe).

## Contributing Organizations

The User Portal has been developed through a collaboration between the following organizations:

.Luxembourg National Data Service (LNDS)

LNDS is Luxembourgâ€™s national infrastructure for managing, sharing, and ensuring access to research data in compliance with FAIR principles.

## User Portal

The User Portal, developed by the Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project, is the central entry point for accessing genomic data. As part of the Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project, it unlocks a vast repository of over one million genome sequences, this platform is currently under development and will serve as the main European-level hub for data access, providing a user-friendly interface for researchers and healthcare professionals.

## Key Objectives

- To link and to provide cross-border access to genomic and related phenotypic datasets across Europe
- To advance understanding of genomics for more precise and faster clinical decision-making, diagnostics, treatments systems, and to benefit the overall economy
- To align with the development under the European Health Data Space (EHDS)
- To facilitate research, policymaking, and healthcare improvements
- To maintain awareness, acceptance, and trust in the main groups of stakeholders, notably European citizens, data holders, healthcare professionals, researchers, and public health authorities
