# Track your application

After submitting your application, **track its progress** and check for any status updates or additional requirements from the Data Access Committee.

To track your application:

1. Select the **folder icon** (<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="currentColor" className="size-5" style={{display: 'inline', width: '1em', height: '1em', verticalAlign: 'text-bottom'}}><path d="M4.75 3A1.75 1.75 0 0 0 3 4.75v2.752l.104-.002h13.792c.035 0 .07 0 .104.002V6.75A1.75 1.75 0 0 0 15.25 5h-3.836a.25.25 0 0 1-.177-.073L9.823 3.513A1.75 1.75 0 0 0 8.586 3H4.75ZM3.104 9a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.673 2.265l1.385 4.5A1.75 1.75 0 0 0 4.488 17h11.023a1.75 1.75 0 0 0 1.673-1.235l1.386-4.5A1.75 1.75 0 0 0 16.896 9H3.104Z"/></svg>) on your dashboard.

2. Select the **APPLICATIONS** tab. The page displays all your applications with their current status, sorted by last modified date:

    In this example, there is one `SUBMITTED` application and one `DRAFT` application:

</figure>

3. Review your application status. Applications can have the following statuses:
   - **DRAFT**: Application is incomplete and has not been submitted yet. [Continue the application](continue-an-application).
   - **SUBMITTED**: Application is under review by the Data Access Committee. 
   - **RETURNED**: Application requires additional information or documents. View the feedback and [continue the application](continue-an-application).
   - **APPROVED**: Application has been approved and you can access the datasets. [Download the datasets](/download-datasets).
   - **REJECTED**: Application has been declined. Select the application to view feedback. To resubmit, create a new application.
   - **CLOSED**: Application is closed and no further action is required. Open the application to view details.
