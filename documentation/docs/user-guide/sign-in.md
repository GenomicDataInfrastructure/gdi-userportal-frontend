## Why sign in?

**Signing in** allows you to access enhanced features and download approved datasets. While you can browse datasets without an account, signing in allows you to:

- **Submit applications** to request dataset access and download approved datasets.
- **Enhance your search** with additional filters and more comprehensive search results.
- **See more dataset information** including `record counts` and other metadata to help assess if datasets meet your research needs.

## Sign in

GDI Portal connects with your **existing accounts** with other platforms such as Google, LinkedIn, and other widely used services so you don't need to create a separate account. For reliable authentication, the portal uses the Login Service for Academic and Administrative Institutions (LSAAI) to handle sign-ins.

To sign in to the GDI Portal:

1. Open the GDI Portal in your browser: https://portal.dev.gdi.lu/.

2. Select **Login** at the top right corner of the page. The login page opens.

3. Select **LSAAI** as your sign-in method.

    :::info Sign in with LSAAI

    GDI Portal requires you to **sign in with LSAAI** (Login Service for Academic and Administrative Institutions). LSAAI is a secure login system that lets you use your existing accounts like Google, LinkedIn, university, or other institutional accounts. This means you don't need to create a new account specifically for the GDI Portal.

3. Select your account provider: Search for your institution in the search bar, or select from the list of options (LinkedIn, Apple, Google, ORCID, GitHub).

3. Follow the instructions to sign in with your selected account. If it's your first time signing in, you may need to verify your email address.
