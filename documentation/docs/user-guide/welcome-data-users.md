# Welcome to GDI Portal

Welcome to the documentation for the **Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) Portal**!

The **GDI Portal** connects you to Europe's largest network of **genomic datasets**—over one million genome sequences from across European countries. As part of the 1+ Million Genomes Initiative, this portal enables **federated and secure** cross-border access to high-quality genomic data and related phenotypic information across European countries.

Whether you're a clinician, scientist, or healthcare policy maker, the GDI Portal is your gateway to Europe's genomic resources to support your work in:

- Research and scientific innovation
- Healthcare and clinical diagnostics
- Health policy making and initiatives

## How it works

Access genomic datasets through a simple, secure process:

1. **Search datasets:** Browse and search through detailed dataset information—search by keywords, research topics, disease areas, data types, or specific genetic variants. [Search datasets](/category/search-datasets-1/).

2. **Request access:** Submit an application to access datasets, and **complete the requirements**. As you may need to provide additional documentation, you can invite collaborators to assist you, or save your application for later completion. [Request access](/category/request-datasets-1/).

3. **Download the data:** You will receive an email once your request is approved, and you can download the data through the portal.

    :::info Stay compliant

    All data are protected by governance frameworks and data access policies to ensure ethical and legal use. Remember to use data responsibly and according to the terms and agreements you signed during the application process.
