# Welcome, catalogue managers

Welcome to the GDI Dataset Catalogue guide!

**The GDI Dataset Catalogue is where you publish and manage genomic dataset records** that contribute to Europe's largest network of federated genomic datasets.

The Dataset Catalogue is accessible at [https://catalogue.portal.gdi.lu](https://catalogue.portal.gdi.lu). The datasets you publish here become discoverable in the [GDI User Portal](https://portal.dev.gdi.lu/), where authorised users can find and request access to genomic data.

**This guide is for catalogue managers**—data managers, stewards, and other professionals—responsible for managing genomic data resources and ensuring they are discoverable and accessible through Europe's Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI).
