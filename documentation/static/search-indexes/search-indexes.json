Many datasets in the portal require prior approval before access is granted. This section will guide you through the process of requesting access, managing your applications, and monitoring their status. Adding Datasets to the Basket Once you've identified datasets that are relevant to your research or project, you can add them to your Basket. The Basket acts as a holding area where you can gather and organize datasets before proceeding with the access request process. This feature is particularly helpful if you're considering multiple datasets and would like to submit a single application for all of them, saving you time and effort. You can add any number of datasets to the Basket, and once you're ready, you can proceed with creating your application to request access to these datasets. Creating an Application To begin the process of requesting access to datasets, follow these steps: 1. Log in to your GDI Portal account. Only logged-in users can submit applications. 2. Navigate to your Basket where the datasets you have added are stored. 3. Click on the Create Application button to start a new access request. 4. Choose the datasets from your Basket that you want to include in the application. 5. Your application will be saved in Draft status, which allows you to review and modify it before submission. Once your application is ready, you can submit it for review. But before submission, ensure that all required fields are filled out and that the relevant documentation is attached. Completing the Application Form Once your application is in Draft status, you will need to fill out all necessary details before submitting it. While the required information can vary depending on the dataset provider, typical requirements include: - Additional Documentation: Some datasets may require supplementary documents, such as ethics approval or data access agreements. These are typically requested for sensitive datasets that involve human or clinical data. - Acceptance of Terms: You must agree to the terms and conditions set by the dataset provider. This is often a legal agreement ensuring responsible use of the data, including adherence to privacy regulations and ethical standards. Remember, specific instructions and required fields will be presented on the application details page, so be sure to follow them closely to ensure your application is complete.",
