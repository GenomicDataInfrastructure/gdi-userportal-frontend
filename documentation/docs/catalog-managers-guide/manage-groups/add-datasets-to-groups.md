**Add datasets to groups** to organise them by common themes or criteria. You can add a dataset to multiple groups, whether you created the groups yourself or they were created by other catalogue managers.

:::tip Have you created the group?
Make sure the group already exists in the catalogue. To create a group first, see: [Create groups](create-groups.md).

## Add datasets to a group

1. Open the dataset you want to add to a group.

2. Select the **Groups** tab. A dropdown appears with the available groups, and below it is a list of the groups the dataset currently belongs to.
