# Continue an application

Continue working on applications that you or other collaborators have started earlier. All incomplete applications are saved as **draft**.

To continue a draft application:

1. Select the **folder icon** (<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="currentColor" className="size-5" style={{display: 'inline', width: '1em', height: '1em', verticalAlign: 'text-bottom'}}><path d="M4.75 3A1.75 1.75 0 0 0 3 4.75v2.752l.104-.002h13.792c.035 0 .07 0 .104.002V6.75A1.75 1.75 0 0 0 15.25 5h-3.836a.25.25 0 0 1-.177-.073L9.823 3.513A1.75 1.75 0 0 0 8.586 3H4.75ZM3.104 9a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.673 2.265l1.385 4.5A1.75 1.75 0 0 0 4.488 17h11.023a1.75 1.75 0 0 0 1.673-1.235l1.386-4.5A1.75 1.75 0 0 0 16.896 9H3.104Z"/></svg>) on your dashboard. 

2. Select the **Applications** tab. The page lists applications, indicating their status. In this example, you have one `SUBMITTED` application and one `DRAFT` application:

2. Select the draft application you want to complete. 

3. Complete the application form by providing all required information or uploading necessary documentation.

4. Review the **Terms & Conditions** and select **Accept All** to agree to the terms.

5. Select **Submit** to submit your completed application. You will receive a confirmation email and be notified of status updates. Or to save and continue later, simply navigate away from the page. The system saves your last completed input.
